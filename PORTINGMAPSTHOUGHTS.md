# thoughts on map ports

## PRELUDE

|level|ported?|thoughts|
|-----|-------|--------|
| 0-1 | [ ] | Too linear, has some good and open areas like the glass panes over a fan room. Might be worth using standalone. |
| 0-2 | [ ] | Ditto, but no good areas. |
| 0-3 | [ ] | Could work with some edits? There are some cool areas. |
| 0-4 | [ ] | Way too linear, but last rooms could be reused standalone. | 
| 0-5 | [ ] | Not really usable, too closed off and short. |

## LIMBO

|-----|-------|--------|
| 1-1 | [ ] | Too linear. |
| 1-2 | [ ] | Bit too quirky to effectively work. |
| 1-3 | [ ] | Perfect, specially with how it loops back. |
| 1-4 | [ ] | Could be good with some edits |

## LUST

| 2-1 | [ ] | Physically extremely linear, it’s literally a fucking bridge, gameplay wise it could work though. |
| 2-2 | [ ] | With some edits to make the map more cyclical, it would be very good |
| 2-3 | [ ] | I hate sheer heart attack so much, but it would be a really good map | 
| 2-4 | [ ] | Too long and linear. |

## GLUTTONY

|-----|-------|--------|
| 3-1 | [ ] | A bit too linear, but some of the rooms could work standalone. | 
| 3-2 | [ ] | Too linear and short, but it could maybe work. |

## GREED

|level|ported?|thoughts|
|-----|-------|--------|
| 4-1 | [ ] | Could actually be really good. |
| 4-2 | [ ] | Could be really good, the open air of it works to it's advantage |
| 4-3 | [ ] | Could be good with lights and edits, specially the last arena. | 
| 4-4 | [ ] | May work at the boss arena, as it's spacious and built for 2 V-robots to fight in. Maybe for 1v1s? |

## WRATH

|level|ported?|thoughts|
|-----|-------|--------|
| 5-1 | [ ] | Water physics are not really good but the first main central arena could be cool somewhat. | 
| 5-2 | [ ] | Too linear, but maybe the ship at the last part could work for small amounts of players. |
| 5-3 | [ ] | Really good, specially the first half of the not flipped over ship. |
| 5-4 | [ ] | Too short.

## HERESY

|-----|-------|--------|
| 6-1 | [ ] | Really good! Both halves of the level could be amazing as an arena shooter. |
| 6-2 | [ ] | Could be really good with some tweaks as well! | 

## VIOLENCE

|level|ported?|thoughts|
|-----|-------|--------|
| 7-1 | [ ] | could work |
| 7-2 | [ ] | could work |
| 7-3 | [ ] | holy SHIT (THE LAST ARENA COULD BE AMAZING) |
| 7-4 | [ ] | I mean if we figure out something it’s gonna be insane |

## PRIME SANCTUMS

|level|ported?|thoughts|
|-----|-------|--------|
| p-1 | [ ] | most boring level in the game absolutely not 
| p-2 | [ ] | Basically perfect for arena gameplay

## ENCORES

|level|ported?|thoughts|
|-----|-------|--------|
| 1-E | [ ] | The circular nature of the level could be amazing, even though it might be a little too claustrophobic for PvP in some rooms. |
| 2-E | [ ] | It also having a circular nature could be great too, but I forsee it needing some tweaks to avoid growing pains. |
